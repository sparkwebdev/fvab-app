    description: "‘the grass is getting long‘ is an artist devised cycle route that draws upon the unique knowledge of local nature, the way we interact with landscape and the ephemeral experience of cycling. \r\n The artist-led route follows the River Forth taking in some of the local architecture and social history. The journey will go along existing paths and at times will also go off the beaten track, with each of the two events taking the route in an opposite direction. (unsuitable for e-bikes). The cycle rides take place on Sun 11th July & Sat 21st August 2pm starting from Stirling Railway Station. Please book from 'Further information' link below.",
