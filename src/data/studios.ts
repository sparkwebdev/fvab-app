It is this location, alongside her emotional connection with the environment that drives her work. <\/p>\n<p>Being outdoors is essential to Lorna\u2019s process and she uses her sketchbook to record observations of the landscape, lochs, and coastlines that she experience. Lorna repeatedly draws and paints the same scene, looking to capture how the different elements: trees, water, and sky, alter depending on time, her mood, perspective, or the ever shifting weather. It is this repetition that gradually reveals a hidden structure to a landscape that we might not see on initial observation. There is a growing preoccupation with how the countryside has been shaped and the form this takes. The further Lorna explores this subject the more she appreciates how the experience of living in a rural setting during childhood, then in a city, and back to the countryside has exacted a strong influence on her practice. <\/p>\n<p>The fluidity of the paint and ink used build a sense of chance and allow a freer interpretation of a landscape to evolve. This mirrors the aim of capturing an often fleeting visceral response to the natural world. As the painting progresses the sketchbook is no longer referenced and the memory of the place and feeling it evoked is of the most value. Lorna is drawn to the cool tones of the countryside but vibrant shots of colour add further energy and a sense of the impact and contrast of a human presence. <\/p>\n","dir":"My studio is located in Dumgoyne.

This year Laura appeared on Landscape Artist of the Year and was listed for The Scottish Portrait Awards, adding to her growing list of achievements. <\/p>\n","desc2":"<p>Laura is a Dunblane local, living and working in her studio at Daisy Cottage. Born in Glasgow of Hebridean heritage, she is influenced and drawn to the wild Landscapes of the Western Isles and West Coast, but also feels fortunate to live in such a stunning location and often paints local scenery working in oils and acrylics. A warm welcome awaits at Daisy Cottage Studio where you can look around the studio, see some work in progress as well as finished pieces and ask any questions about her work, history, processes etc. A must is paying a visit to Laura\u2019s little gallery, \u201cThe Loovre\u201d and the see the famous \u201cMoaning Lisa\u201d. As Laura said \u201cit\u2019s a bit of fun really. I don\u2019t have a lovely white walled gallery in little cottage, so I had to think out of the box and The Loo-vre was born. It always brings a smile and I can fit a surprising amount of finished pieces in there. As the original Louvre is famous for the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, I gave my Loo-vre my Moaning Lisa, by Lauranardo da Vino\u201d. But getting back to the real work, Laura\u2019s following continues to grow with pieces sold worldwide. Her c.v includes being hung in RSA London, short listed twice for RSA, finalist in BBC Artist of the Year, winner of the McFarlane prize, Royal Institute for Fine Arts, listed for The Scottish Portrait Awards and this year appeared on Sky Arts Landscape Artist of the Year. She adds \u201cI don\u2019t work to shock or make statements, but to share what I find beauty or joy in\u201d. <\/p>\n","dir":"From south, take Dunblane at the Keir Roundabout (B8033), past M&amp;S on right, to The Fourways Roundabout - keep straight on Daisy Cottage is approx 1\/3 mile on right.

Her designs are simple but tactile in vibrant colours. Isaksson also creates larger bespoke glass installations and lighting for private indi- viduals and businesses. Previous commissions include Abrdn (Standard Life) and National Museum of Scotland.<\/p>\n","desc2":"<p>Elin Isaksson is originally from Sweden, and she began her glass training at the Orrefors Glass School, next door to the crystal factory. She moved to the UK in 2001, and after graduating from Edinburgh College of Art in 2006 with an MA in Design&amp;Applied Arts, she stayed on as Artist in Residence building up her portfolio. Further training includes master classes with Rudi Gritch in Venice, then latter with Dante Marioni and Simon Moore at Northland Glass Centre in Lybster. Isaksson set up her own glass blowing studio in 2010 and she is now based in Dunblane. <\/p>\n<p>Isaksson's inspiration is nature, and her forms are often unfussy but very tactile, drawing from her deep-rooted Scandinavian glass making background. Her latest work are her sand cast 'Rocks' and the motivation comes from the play of light using and recreating textures in the glass and realizing interesting depth within a piece by layering different glass materiel to create a large unique sculptural piece. Rock cast's are inspired by found rocks and Isaksson is trying to create many textures and layers and catching the light by using muted colours within the piece. To create delicate colour blends she blow her own coloured shards to create a personal colour palate to use. To create a subtle and delicate watercolour effect she layers the glass thinly by creating a collage with glass stringers, glass crystals and gold leaf. Molten glass +1200c is lastly poured into the mould which fuses the colours onto the piece.<\/p>\n","dir":"Follow brown sign for the cathedral.

His current focus is painting realist landscapes and seeing them evolve into surrealist abstract works. As a painter for forty years, he is largely self-taught. His understanding of colour and fabrics has been significant in his day job, making high-end clothing. The combination of being a hands-on artisan and artist gives Bobby Rennie\u2019s work a strength and depth that reflects the mysticism of the landscape and ancient forests which frequently feature in his paintings.
