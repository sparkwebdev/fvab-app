She is inspired by the changing seasons, plants and forms found in nature and the sense of joy, wonder, reassurance and comfort that can be felt by time spent outside, walking and experiencing different elements of the countryside; trees, flowers, light effects, colours, organic forms and shapes. She combines drawing and studies outside with time spent in the studio working up images into paintings that try to convey the sense of joy and peace that come from finding an ancient beech tree or a bluebell glade. She's also had a lifelong fascination with faces, character and the human form, an interest that prompted her portrait commission work, and since discovering oils, a number of paintings of family and friends. The idea of motherhood recently resulted in a series of paintings exploring the connection between mothers and their children.

She was hooked!\r\n\r\nPursuing her new passion, she enrolled in formal training at the Orrefors Glass School in the famous region of Kingdom of Glass. Here she learned basics of glass blowing.\r\n\r\nElin moved to Scotland in 2001 to study for her BA (Hons) in Glass at Edinburgh College of Art (ECA). She then graduated with an MA in Applied Arts in 2006 and continued at ECA as Artist in Residence for another two years teaching undergraduates the basics of glassblowing whilst building her portfolio of commissions. Further training followed, including master classes with Dante Marioni and Simon Moore at North Lands Glass Centre in Lybster. She set up her first studio in Alloa in 2010 and in 2019 the workshop finally found its forever home in Dunblane where Elin and her family lives. \r\n\r\nElin design and creates functional handblown glassware, interiors accessories and unique sand cast pieces for the home. Her glass can be found in many galleries throughout the UK.\r\n\r\nElin\u2019s work is inspired by her early Scandinavian glass training and the minimalist and functional forms which still influence her work today.\r\nHer designs often reveal a sense of movement, capturing the inherent energy and fluidity of working with molten glass.","desc3":"Glass Blowing Demonstrations: \r\nFri 17th June\r\n\r\nWe aim to hold demonstrations in glass blowing on Friday 17th June. \r\nFor more and info and how to book please visit our News page on our website at www.elinisakssonglass.com","desc3Image":"Elin-Isaksson-069.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&ssl=1","dir":"Aim for the Cathedral and keep going up the hill and go past the Braeport centre.

The 'Second Chancers' exhibition explores the lives of individuals with experience of the community justice system, and 'Hope', created by artist George Berrie, which ponders Maslow's hierarchy of needs in surrealist form.\r\nThere are also newly acquired artworks to be seen, and paintings by Elizabeth Blackadder and Joan Eardley.","desc3":"16mm Film Workshop with artist-in-residence Jennifer Wicks\r\n14+15 June 11am-4pm\r\n& Art Collection Tours:\r\nDuring FVAB - Mon 11am, Weds 11am or 3pm, Fri 11am\r\n\r\nDrop in and join us on a two-day 16mm film workshop to create experimental, animated films and soundtracks without a camera.\r\nUsing Norman McLaren as a starting point, you will draw, sew or scratch directly onto 16mm film to create a community collaborative 16mm film.
