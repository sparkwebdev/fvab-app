I use natural materials in my work, such as slate and stone, adding in pieces of glass to create contrast and visual interest. I use a range of tools and techniques to transform pieces of slate and stone from large lumps of rock, to small, individual pieces (tesserae). These tesserae are carefully placed by hand into a bed of adhesive to create a unique piece of mosaic art. Over the last year I have also worked on various community projects and regularly run workshops from my studio in Dunblane.\r\n\r\nGwen - I'm an ecologist, a textile artist and a mother to a wonderful (and surprisingly loud!) five-year-old boy. As an ecologist, I am fascinated by our incredible natural world and my felt paintings are inspired by Scotland's beautiful landscapes and wonderful wildlife. The paintings are created by carefully building up layers of coloured wool and fixing them in place using wet-felting and needlefelting techniques. Additional detail is added using free-motion machine embroidery and free-hand embroidery. \r\n\r\nWe welcome you to visit the studio, where you can view a range of our work and enjoy a cuppa and some home baking at the same time!
